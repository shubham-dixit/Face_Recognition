# Face Recognition using Haar-Cascade Classifier, OpenCV, and Python
Simple Face Recognition algorithm using Python and OpenCV

## Requirement
- Python 3.5
- OpenCV 3.4.0
- Numpy

## Outline
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:
1. Creating datasets (face_datasets.py)
2. Train the model (training.py)
3. Face Recognition (face_iden.py)
